Observations:
1. General Trends:
   - Orders and sales are generally correlated: As the number of orders increases, so does the sales revenue.
   - There's no significant seasonal dip or spike across months; the values are relatively stable with minor fluctuations.
2. Specific Months:

   - Lowest sales and orders: February has the lowest orders (114) and revenue (approx. 57,189).
3. Outliers/Patterns:
   - August has a higher-than-average sales amount compared to its relatively low order count, indicating possible high-value orders that month.
   - December has a steady number of orders but a noticeable drop in sales revenue compared to November.
 Potential Insights:
